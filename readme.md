# Unicorn Vet Group - NodeJS Backend Test :unicorn: 

< add documentation >

### Project details

This example test uses [@hapi](https://hapi.dev) as a basic REST
framework. You don't need to use Hapi, if you feel it might save you
time you can switch to anything you'd like (even GraphQL), but out of
the interest of saving **you** time, we've bootstrapped the project and
some of the REST calls.

### Instructions

- Test instructions will be sent to you over email, please read them
  carefully.
- Please click `Use This Template` in the github repo to get started.
- This template is a suggestion, feel free to ignore, rewrite, or install favourite packages as you see fit.
- Try to make small commits at least every 20 minutes so we can track progress.
- Please stop before 2 hours and make a final commit if you run out of time
- We expect all tests to always be runable (something is displayed after npm start) state, but don't necessarily expect you to finish.
- For hints on possible best practices see:
  [Best Practices](./best_practices.md)
