# Best Practics üç≠

Here are some tips for a successful test:

- Focus on your strengths within the time limit, but make sure the project is always runnable.
- Do what you can and do it well, you don't necessarily have to finish.  
- Strive for (small) granular commits to show your progress.
- Consider how the reviewer will test correct behavior.
- Think about this test as a project you'd want to work on, what would you want to see in such a project and what will it make easy for you and your colleagues to maintain and extend the project.
